       <p>The idea to start this service was the personal experience during the great Covid times. A young man was craving his hometown snacks in his current city. Unable to return home and ‘stranded’ in a different city he survived on burgers and snacks which were not even close to the delicious taste he was looking for. He told two of his friends about it and they found this was actually a real problem! </p>
       <ul>
        <li>We should start a company to sell regional products with the original taste, said one. And to have the best taste, the products should come directly from the places these are famous for, said another. And these should directly reach the customers with the maximum freshness they can get, said the third.</li>
       </ul>
       
       <p>Presto! an idea blossomed among these IIT Kharagpur and IIM Mumbai graduates - Ayush Banwal, Yuvraj Anand, Sashil Dath and Kunal Singh. Peepl was born.</p>
